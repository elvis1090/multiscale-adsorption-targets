## Model function
```multiscale_adsorption_target_models.py``` contains the model and workflow functions necessary to generate the results and figures in this manuscript.

## Pb remediation case study
```Pb_remediation.ipynb``` contains the scripts to generate results and figures for the Pb remediation case study in the manuscript. This script uses the data file 'sorbent_prop.csv' to load properties of existing adsorbents.

## Li recovery case study
```Li_recovery.ipynb``` contains the scripts to generate results and figures for the Li recovery case study in the manuscript. This script uses the data file 'lithium_adsorbents_2.csv' to load properties of existing adsorbents.

## Scale up behavior of batch and semicontinuous processes
```scaleup_behavior.ipynb``` contains the scripts to generate results and figures for the study of scale up behavior of batch and semicontinuous processes.

## Dimensionless material property targets
```Dimensionless_MPT.ipynb``` contains the scripts to generate results and figures for dimensionless material property target contours in the Supporting Information of the manuscript.
